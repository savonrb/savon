## Version 2

Savon version 2 is available through [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/savon) and can be installed via:

```
$ gem install savon
```

or add it to your Gemfile like this:

```
gem 'savon', '~> 2.3.0'
```

Savon versions >= 2.3 depend on a recent version of Nokogiri. If you are
installing Savon for Ruby 1.8, you will need to install a 1.8-compatible
version of Nokogiri manually, or specify the latest compatible version
in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nokogiri', '>= 1.4', '< 1.6'
```

## Maintainer needed

So I've been maintaining Savon and its dependant projects for the last four years and it's become quite  
apparent now with my schedule I do not have the time to keep this project going single-handed.

Luckily there are numerous people helping out from time to time, but maintaining this project is pretty  
much a full-time job and it keeps me from working on the next major version.

I'll be able to contribute on a small scale going forward, and will do my best in the meantime to catch  
up with everything I am behind on.

If you are interested, please email me at [me at rubiii dot com].  
I'll do everything I can to help you get started.


## Usage example

``` ruby
require 'savon'

# create a client for the service
client = Savon.client(wsdl: 'http://service.example.com?wsdl')

client.operations
# => [:find_user, :list_users]

# call the 'findUser' operation
response = client.call(:find_user, message: { id: 42 })

response.body
# => { find_user_response: { id: 42, name: 'Hoff' } }
```

For more examples, you should check out the
[integration tests](https://github.com/savonrb/savon/tree/version2/spec/integration).
